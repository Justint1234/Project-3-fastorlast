# Project-3-fastorlast
For my 3rd project I wanted to create a racing app. This app would give you a choice of 6 high powered and fast vehicles to go against and also be racing against 6 different drivers with different stats. Each driver and car come with their own info. You will be able to see the specs of the car such as color, horsepower, type, make, model, and year of the vehicle. As for the driver you can their wins, losses, experience, and location. This app will give you the need for speed and to burn rubber against any of the 6 oppenents you choose.
